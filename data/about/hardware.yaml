  en: We combine the latest in drone, laser, and photogrammetric technology with the power of super computers to produce the highest quality images and 3D models.<br>
      <br>Iconem has developed an innovative processing method exclusively for recording threatened cultural heritage sites. The result of our partnerships with INRIA, Franceâ€™s national computer science research centre, and Microsoft Research, our technology seamlessly integrates multiple levels of data to build extremely precise 3D models of cultural heritage sites. Our smart merging functionality flawlessly combines laser scanner, photogrammetry, and Lidar data in one model, ensuring the highest quality data and images. Infinite data processing integrates details, accurate to the millimetre, into site-wide scans, enabling new applications for big data in the cultural heritage field. Our technology uses faster processing speeds and reduces costs while producing a more photorealistic 3D model.<br>
      <br>We are also launching an intuitive, open-source platform that will make our 3D models accessible to archaeologists, architects, international organisations, companies and the general public alike. Users will be able to explore our 3D models and use them to take measurements, identify GPS locations, and generate technical architectural drawings all via our online platform. This resource will also serve as a database to facilitate the study of endangered cultural heritage.<br>
      <br>Our data meet our high technical standards for accuracy and consistency to ensure that our realistic 3D models are optimised for archaeological assessment, architectural analysis, and all media forms.
